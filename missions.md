## Missions

A big part of Church for Life is our missions focus. We take Jesus' command to make disciples of all nations seriously. To achieve that we support missionaries in a number of nations around the world who are implementing programs that demonstrate the life and love of Jesus to those around them.

We also involve ourselves in various local programs where we model a christian lifestyle amongst our community. We understand a disciple to be a person who voluntarily chooses to adopt the teachings of a leader, in our case Jesus Christ. Missions, then, is the process of introducing people to the concepts such as sin, salvation, eternal life, forgiveness, acceptance, love, faith, hope, perseverance and overcoming those things that hold us back from a relationship with a loving God.
